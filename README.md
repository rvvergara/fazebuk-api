## Background

Previously I co-worked on a [project](https://github.com/dipto0321/facialbook) that built a full-stack Rails [Facebook clone](https://facials.herokuapp.com/). While that was fun to build, there were lots of limitations posed by my skills in working with JavaScript on Rails. Further, I wanted to utilize the power of React but didn't want to put all logic for Rails and React in one huge application. For this reason I decided to create a shadow application that splits the front and backend.
