## Background

Previously I co-worked on a [project](https://github.com/dipto0321/facialbook) that built a full-stack Rails [Facebook clone](https://facials.herokuapp.com/). While that was fun to build, there were lots of limitations posed by my skills in working with JavaScript on Rails. Further, I wanted to utilize the power of React but didn't want to put all logic for Rails and React in one huge application. For this reason I decided to create a shadow application that splits the front and backend.

Use either `httpie` on the terminal or Postman to do requests

**Endpoints (all examples use httpie)**

1. User Creation

```bash
$ http POST :3000/v1/users user:='{"username":"john123", "email":"johnny_bravo@email.org", "first_name":"John", "last_name":"Doe", "password":"password", "password_confirmation":"password"}'
```

2. User data update

```bash
# assuming username is john123
$ http PUT :3000/v1/users/john123 user:='{"first_name":"Johnny the Great"}'
```

3. Deleting user

```bash
# assuming username is john123
$ http DELETE :3000/v1/users/john123
```

4. Signing in a user through email and password

```bash
# assuming user email is johnny_bravo@email.com and password is 'password'
$ http POST :3000/v1/sessions email=johnny_bravo@email.com password=password
```

5. Signing in a user through Facebook/User creation (if user doesn't exist yet)

````bash
# for this to work we should have a Facebook access_token
$ http GET :3000/v1/auth/facebook?access_token=<facebook access token here>
### Friendship endpoints

6. Sending a friend request

```bash
# assuming you are logged in and has a token generated from signing in
# assuming username of user to send request to is 'mildred'
$ http POST :3000/v1/friendships?friend_requested=mildred "Authorization: Bearer <your user token here>"
````

7. Cancelling a friend request

```bash
# assuming you are logged in as the same user that sent mildred a request
# you can get the friendship_id thru the rails console
$ http DELETE :3000/v1/friendships/<friendship_id> "Authorization: Bearer <your token here>"
```

8. Confirming a friend request

```bash
# assuming now you are logged on as mildred
$ http PUT :3000/v1/friendships/<friendship_id> "Authorization: Bearer <mildred's token here>"
```

9. Rejecting a friend request

```bash
# still assuming mildred is logged on
$ http DELETE :3000/v1/friendships/<friendship_id> "Authorization: Bearer <mildred's token here>"
```

10. Checking a user's list of friends

```bash
# friends are listed 10 each per page
# to check first 10 friends either include query parameter '?page=<page>' or simply
$ http GET :3000/v1/users/<username of user>/friends "Authorization: Bearer <your token here>"

# to check next 10 friends (on page 2)
$ http GET :3000/v1/users/<username of user>/friends?page=2 "Authorization: Bearer <your token here>"
```

11. Checking your mutual friends with another user

```bash
# assuming you wanna see your mutual friends with mildred
# mutual friends are listed 10 per page. you can either specify page=1
# but to check succeeding mutual friends you must specify which page
$ http GET :3000/v1/users/mildred/mutual_friends?page=<page you wanna see> "Authorization: Bearer <your token here>"
```

12. Viewing your newsfeed posts

```bash
# assuming you are logged on and have a token
# if page param isn't included then request will go to page 1
$ http GET :3000/v1/newsfeed_posts?page=<which page you wish to view> "Authorization: Bearer <your token>"
```

13. Viewing a user's timeline posts

```bash
# assuming you are logged on and have a token

# in the frontend if you wish to post on your newsfeed just input above your own username in the postable param
```

15. Updating your post

# assuming you are logged on and have a token
# assuming you posted on jill's timeline and you are updating that post
$ http PUT :3000/v1/posts/<id of post> post:='{"postable": "jill", "content": "This is an updated content"}' "Authorization: Bearer <your token here>"
